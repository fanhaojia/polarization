# Ploarization

 These scripts are used to calculate the polarization of ferroelectric materials.
 Note:
 It is for VASP calculations;
 The method is modern polarization theory proposed by David Vanderbilt etc. al.
 
 The polarization contains two parts:
 the electronic contribution and ion contribution
 
 Fristly, you should have one non-centered symmetry phase and its reference phase.
 In order to avoid polarized quantum number, you need to do interpolation between two phases.
